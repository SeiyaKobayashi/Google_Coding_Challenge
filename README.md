# Google_Coding_Challenge
Here I solved Google's coding problems (https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com) just for solidifying my understandings of concepts in Computer Science and for enhancing my programming skills. 

## Challenge#1 (Implemented in Python)
[Challenge: Find longest word in dictionary that is a subsequence of a given string](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/find-longest-word-in-dictionary-that-subsequence-of-given-string#code-challenge)


## Challenge#2 (Implemented in Java)
[Challenge: Minesweeper](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/foundational/coding-question-minesweeper/#code-challenge)

## Challenge#3 (Implemented in Python)
[Challenge: Compression and Decompression](https://techdevguide.withgoogle.com/paths/advanced/compress-decompression/#code-challenge)
